# Pokemon Memory Game

This project was part of The Odin Project's JavaScript curriculum. The goal of this project was to create a memory game from scratch using React. The game randomly fetches 15 random pokemon out of thousands available from pokeapi and shuffles the pokemon and displays 5 every round. Goal of the game is to memorize the pokemon you clicked and click on the ones you havent seen before.
